# Security History & Secret Exposure

## Overview
This document tracks security incidents and remediation steps for the CodeShare repository.

## Prior Secret Exposure (Resolved)

### Issue: Hardcoded Secrets in Repository
**Date**: Prior to production hardening
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: RESOLVED

#### Exposed Secrets:
- JWT secrets in `application.yml`
- Database credentials in configuration files
- API keys in frontend environment files
- NextAuth secrets in configuration

#### Remediation Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Moved all secrets to environment variables
2. ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
3. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude all `.env*` files
4. ✅ Added pre-commit hooks to prevent future exposure
5. ✅ Created security documentation and procedures

#### Files Previously Containing Secrets:
- `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (JWT secrets, DB credentials)
- `frontend/.env*` files (API keys, NextAuth secrets)
- Various configuration files with hardcoded values

#### Current Security Status:
- ✅ All secrets moved to environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in repository
- ✅ Environment variable validation in place
- ✅ Security scanning enabled in CI/CD

## Key Rotation Required

After implementing git history scrubbing (see `scripts/git_history_scrub.sh`), the following keys MUST be rotated:

### Backend Keys:
- [ ] JWT_SECRET - Generate new 256-bit secret
- [ ] Database passwords - Rotate all DB credentials
- [ ] S3 access keys (if used) - Rotate AWS credentials

### Frontend Keys:
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_SECRET - Generate new secret
- [ ] API keys (OpenAI, Google, etc.) - Rotate all third-party keys
- [ ] Stripe keys (if used) - Rotate payment credentials

### Infrastructure:
- [ ] Deploy tokens - Re-issue all deployment tokens
- [ ] CI/CD secrets - Rotate GitHub Actions secrets
- [ ] Monitoring keys - Rotate observability credentials

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables only
2. **Regular key rotation** - Rotate keys quarterly
3. **Security scanning** - Run dependency and secret scans in CI
4. **Access review** - Regular review of who has access to secrets
5. **Audit logging** - Monitor access to sensitive resources
