## Two-Browser Demo

Experience real-time collaboration by opening CodeShare in two different browsers:

### Step 1: Register Two Users
1. **Browser 1**: Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Register"
   - Email: `alice@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Click "Register"

2. **Browser 2**: Open `http://localhost:3000` (or use incognito)
   - Click "Register"
   - Email: `bob@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Click "Register"

### Step 2: Create a Room
1. In **Browser 1** (Alice):
   - Click "Create Room"
   - Name: `Demo Room`
   - Language: `JavaScript`
   - Click "Create"

2. Copy the room URL from the address bar

### Step 3: Join the Room
1. In **Browser 2** (Bob):
   - Paste the room URL
   - You should see Alice's cursor and any text she types

### Step 4: Real-time Collaboration
1. **Alice** types: `function hello() {`
2. **Bob** sees the text appear in real-time
3. **Bob** adds: `  console.log("Hello World!");`
4. **Alice** sees Bob's addition immediately
5. **Alice** completes: `}`

### Step 5: See Presence Indicators
- Both users should see each other's avatars in the user list
- Cursors should be visible with different colors
- Typing indicators show when someone is actively editing
