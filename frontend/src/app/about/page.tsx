            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              MyApp was founded by <strong>Sari Hammad</strong>, a developer and
              designer with a passion for minimal tools and meaningful
              productivity. Tired of cluttered to-do lists and generic planning
              apps, he built MyApp as a smarter, calmer way to make progress
              every day.
